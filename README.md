# Pneumonia Prediction 🫁

A deep learning-based project that detects pneumonia from chest X-ray images using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## 🔍 Overview
This project uses a CNN architecture to classify chest X-ray images as either **Normal** or **Pneumonia**. It includes preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## 📁 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle - Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)
- Classes: `NORMAL`, `PNEUMONIA`

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib, NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pneumonia-prediction.git
cd pneumonia-prediction
jupyter notebook
